    ### Machine Learning Models Used
    
    SpamShield uses multiple machine learning models to classify emails:
    
    1. **Naive Bayes**: Fast and effective for text classification
    2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Great for high-dimensional data like text
    3. **Random Forest**: Ensemble method with good explanatory power
    4. **Logistic Regression**: Simple but effective probabilistic classifier
    
    Each model has different strengths, which is why we provide all of them for your use.
